# cergen-tensor-lib
Simple tensor library for CENG403 THE1 (Spring 2024). Implemented without NumPy or PyTorch.
# CerGen: A Minimal Tensor Library in Pure Python

This is my solution for the first take-home exam (THE1) of CENG403: Deep Learning.  
It includes a custom tensor class `gergen`, built without using NumPy, PyTorch, or any external libraries.
